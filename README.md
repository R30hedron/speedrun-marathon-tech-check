# Speedrun Marathon Tech Check Documentation
This github repository contains documentation and scripts to assist with tech checks for small speedrun marathons.

### For Tech Checkers:
[View the tech checker guide]()

### For Event Organizers or Event Tech Staff:
This tech check guide is meant for events with their tech built off of or based on the [Speedrun Marathon in a Box](https://github.com/R30hedron/speedrun-marathon-in-a-box) setup. Note that it is still under construction! At a minimum, you will need the following:

- Dummy Twitch Channels for your event (of the form eventname1a, eventname1b, ..., eventname2a, eventname2b, ...)
- A Google Sheets spreadsheet containing all combinations of runners and games
- Runners using the [Marathon Runner OBS]()
